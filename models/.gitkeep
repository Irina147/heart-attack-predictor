# This file keeps the models directory in Git
# Even when .pkl files are ignored in .gitignore

Place your model files here:
- best_model.pkl (your trained ML model)
- best_threshold.pkl (optimized threshold value)

These files are essential for the API to work but are 
excluded from Git version control due to their size.

To add your models:
1. Train and save your model in Jupyter notebook:
   import joblib
   joblib.dump(model, 'models/best_model.pkl')
   joblib.dump(threshold, 'models/best_threshold.pkl')

2. Ensure they are in this directory before running the API
